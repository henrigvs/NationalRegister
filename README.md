This is a project developed for the course of Algorithmic II (BAC3) at University of Namur in 2022.


The program takes in entry a file with lists of names :

First line : Number of tests

Nexts lines : the tests

=> For each test, the first line correspond at the number of words in the test

=> For each test, the second line correspond at the list of words in the test


The test are componed of a list of current names given in Belgium.
If # of a name > n/2 (the program return this name, if not it return null) => A test case is present into this repo


2 kinds of algorithm are present :

- A iterative algorithm (naive algo)

- A recursive algorithm (Divide&Conquer => boosted by Dynamic Programming with a hashtable caching the datas)


The entire code is specified with openJML
